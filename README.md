# Big-Data-Technologies-Bay-Area-Flood-Prediction-using-AWS-Tools
Recently, the severity and frequency of natural disasters, particularly flooding, have increased due to climate change. Over the past decade, California has witnessed an average of a 34% YoY increase in flooding events. However, due to a lack of awareness, the number of flood insurance policies sought in the same period has dropped by 5.8%. The latest 2023 floods in California resulted in financial losses worth $31 billion, six times higher than the national average of flood-related financial losses since 2009. This project recognizes that heavy rains stand as the leading cause of flooding events and utilize climate (rainfall) data and flooding events data from NOAA, as well as insurance policies data from FEMA, to develop a data warehouse that can help in efficient analytics and deriving data-driven insights for better-informed flood-related policy-making. This project leverages the big data analytics engine Spark with Python Programming on the Google Colaboratory VMs for exploratory data analytics and the data analytics platform, Tableau for creating compelling visual dashboards. AWS technologies, such as S3 for data storage, GLUE for ETL operations, Redshift for data warehousing, and Redshift Query Editor for query data analytics, were employed. Furthermore, this project provides an end-to-end comprehensive real-world big data solution by building a web portal with Single-Sign-On functionality built with Google Firebase, allowing authorized users to download the Redshift data tables and view the tableau dashboards. Overall, the proposed big data platform offers a complete one-stop analytics solution for addressing the challenges posed by flooding events in California and demonstrates the feasibility of big data analytics in mitigating risks associated with natural disasters through data-driven insights for policy-making.
