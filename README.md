# Big Data Technologies: Bay Area Flood Prediction using AWS Tools

## Project Overview
This project tackles the challenge of increasing flood events in California due to climate change, with a focus on the Bay Area. Despite a 34% average yearly increase in flooding, there's been a decline in the adoption of flood insurance policies. The catastrophic 2023 floods in California, resulting in $31 billion in damages, underscore the urgency for improved flood-related policy-making. Our solution is a data warehouse that offers efficient analytics and insights for better decision-making.

## Context and Importance
- **Rising Flood Events**: With a significant yearly increase in flood occurrences, California's crisis is worsening due to climate change.
- **Insurance Policy Gap**: Despite more frequent floods, there's a noticeable decrease in the number of flood insurance policies.
- **Economic Impact**: The 2023 California floods highlighted the stark need for improved analytics in flood prediction and policy planning.

## Data and Technologies
- **Data Sources**: Utilizes rainfall data from NOAA and insurance policy data from FEMA.
- **Data Analytics**: Leverages Apache Spark with Python on Google Colab VMs for exploratory data analysis and Tableau for visual dashboards.
- **AWS Suite**: Employs AWS S3, GLUE, Redshift, and Redshift Query Editor for robust data storage, ETL operations, and warehousing.

## Solution Highlights
- **End-to-End Data Platform**: Provides a comprehensive solution for flood prediction and policy-making analytics.
- **Web Portal**: Features a web portal with Single-Sign-On using Google Firebase, allowing authorized access to Redshift data tables and Tableau dashboards.

## Impact and Future Work
The big data platform developed in this project represents a step forward in harnessing the power of big data analytics to mitigate natural disaster risks and support data-driven policy-making in California.
